        Shorts appear to be exiting their positions. There's a lot of speculation about how this is happening, or
        whether it is truly happening at all - there are tactics that can be used manipulate disclosed short short
        interest - but the short interest numbers we've been following all along are definitely trending down.
      </li>
      <li>
        how often is this site updated? As often as the data is updated. Typically this is daily, before market open.
      </li>
      <li>
        is the squeeze ever going to be squoze? possibly. short interest is still high, but it'll take some sort of catalyst:
        without one, at this point it's more likely short repurchasing continues as a gradual upward pressure, rather than a
        sudden mass event that causes the price to explode.

    <h3>Public Service Announcement</h3>
    <p><i>
        This is not a game. The people who originated this meme like to have fun with stupid stock bets, we like to
        pretend we're monkeys throwing darts, but though we enjoy talking like idiots, we actually do know the
        difference between delta and theta. We understand what role a clearinghouse performs. We were playing GME weeks
        ago, at $10-$50, as it became clear that DFV was actually right. We put in money we could afford to lose,
        because we knew we were speculating on a potential short squeeze.
      </i></p>
    <p><i>
        If these statements don't describe you - if you don't know options greeks, if you don't understand how the
        market works, and especially if you are gambling with money that would cause you problems if you didn't have it
        anymore - then pull your head out of your ass, return to the real world with your real obligations and expenses,
        and don't increase your exposure any more. There's an emotional high in gambling, especially when you're doing
        it with lots of other euphoric people. Don't let it screw up your life.
      </i></p>
    <p><i>
        This is not an epic crusade to get retribution on the financial sector for its reckless greed and the damage
        it's done to people's lives. It's just a stock play, undertaken to make money off of some hedge funds who got
        caught in an overexposed position. The financial industry as a whole does not care. This is just a blip on its
        radar.

    <h3>wat</h3>
    <p>
      OK, listen up, you late-to-the-party, crayon-eating homunculus, here's what's going on:
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the past year, hedge fund supervillains have made money by selling shares of Gamestop they don't actually own
      - they've just borrowed them. Short selling. If they sell enough they can drive the price down so far that when
      they eventually need to return the shares they borrowed, they can get them cheap. It's free money. They throw a
      couple hundred mil at this, chill in their offices watching live video feeds of homeless people being
      exsanguinated on the hoods of their vintage sports cars, write up an investor report, and call it a fiscal year.
    </p>
    <p>
      They borrowed and sold a record amount - they sold more shares, in fact, than are actually traded, far more than
      Gamestop's float. This shouldn't have been allowed to happen and probably means they were selling
      shares they never even bothered to borrow - naked shorts. (Where were you on that one, SEC?) Essentially, they
      were simultaneously betting on Gamestop going bankrupt and doing their best to drive them into bankruptcy. It's a
      good tactic when you need to find a way to pay for your old wife's alimony and your new wife's poolboy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it presents an opportunity for the savvy degenerate gambler. Because these shares eventually need to be
      returned - after all, it does cost these funds money to borrow a share. And the higher the price goes, the more
      unstable
      it becomes, the more it costs to borrow. This means that at some point, they need to buy back those borrowed
      shares they
      sold.
    </p>
    <p>
      All 140% of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      So our visionary gambler, if they were to invest in Gamestop, would have a guaranteed buyer for their shares. And
      if millions of fellow degenerates were to ask their mother for an advance on their allowance so that they could
      buy Gamestop, too -
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, if a famous e-commerce CEO were to buy a ton of Gamestop shares, join the board, and announce they're
      going to be a big company again by doing internet things and esports and radical new stuff -
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, if a truly insane amount of call option buying - don't worry about it if you don't know - were to force
      market makers to rapidly buy up a ton of shares to fulfill all those options they sold in a wild phenomenon called
      a gamma squeeze that's basically the stock equivalent of an atmospheric microburst, suddenly spiking Gamestop's
      price to unheard-of levels -
    </p>
    <p>
      - hang on, I need a new pair of pants -
    </p>
    <p>
      Well then you'd have the perfect conditions for a short squeeze. The price is insanely high. There's a whole
      street of funds with deep pockets who absolutely must find a way to buy all those insanely expensive shares. And
      by buying them - 140% of the amount traded! - they're going to drive up the price even more. So one day, a fund
      will run out of money paying interest on their borrowed shares, and they'll have to drive GME's price through the
      roof
      buying enough shares to give
      them back. And as the price climbs, other short holders are going to be required to cover their borrowed shares by
      buying them. It's a runaway reaction where the more it happens, the more it happens. You know, one of those cute
      little phenomena like virus spread. Or nuclear bombs.
    </p>
    <p>
      So who are they buying from? That's right. At what price are they buying? Well, that depends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hedge fund managers holding GME shorts would really, really like to convince GME stock holders to sell them some
      shares right now, before it climbs any higher, so that they can return the shares they borrowed and get out before
      they get steamrolled into bankrupcy. And they've got lots of tools at their disposal to do this: they can pump up
      other stocks to create FOMO, causing GME holders to sell their shares to go chase some shiny new meme. They can
      hire PR companies to astroturf these stocks on Elon Musk fan clubs and gambling forums. They can buy up shares and
      then, after trading hours are over, sell them in progressively cheaper tranches to drive down the stock price.
      They can wipe the hobo blood off their wattle and go cry on television about how they're being bullied.
      They can call up their investors, like Citadel, the company who processes all your orders, and tell them to stop
      letting people buy Gamestop while they try to drive the price down. They have,
      in fact, tried all of these things. But it hasn't worked - GME's price is higher than ever. It's out of control,
      now - there are too many people involved. There are other institutions involved, trying to extract maximum profit
      out of the shorts. The meme has reached critical mass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it's a classic million-player prisoner's dilemma: every GME holder has visions of selling their shares for
      unlimited chicken tendies and cocaine dipping sauce. Maybe they think they alone can sell, while everyone else can
      continue to drive the price up by holding. But if every degenerate gambler thought this way, and sold their
      shares, very quickly the short squeeze wouldn't happen. Short holders would buy up all the shares being sold at a
      painful but manageable loss, they would cover their position, and the nuke would never be detonated.
    </p>
    <p>
      What's a prisoner in this dilemma to do? At last, the point arrives. To avoid selling too early, the savvy
      degenerate gambler would wait until short interest - the amount of shares shorted out there - started to decline
      substantially. As long as nobody was defecting, nobody selling early, that decline in shares shorted would come
      with a spike in the price of the stock, as the few shares available are bought at astronomical prices. And this
      decline in shares shorted would distinguish this spike from gamma squeezes or regular old stock run-ups.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then and only then, as the nuke goes off, the stock price ascends past Alpha Centauri, and the short interest
      finally starts declining, the short squeeze has begun. And then it's every gambler for themself.
